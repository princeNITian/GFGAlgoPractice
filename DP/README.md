- [Ugly Numbers](1.py) 
    >- Ugly numbers are numbers whose only prime factors are 2, 3 or 5. The sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, … shows the first 11 ugly numbers. By convention, 1 is included.

    >- Given a number n, the task is to find n’th Ugly number.
    
- [Fibonacci Numbers](2.py)

    - The Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence.
    0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ……..
    - In mathematical terms, the sequence Fn of Fibonacci numbers is defined by the recurrence relation **Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2** with seed values **F0 = 0 and F1 = 1**.

    - Given a number n, print n-th Fibonacci Number.
